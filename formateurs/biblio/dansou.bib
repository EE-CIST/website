	abstract = {Fertility in sub-Saharan Africa is among the highest globally and relatively higher in West Africa compared to the other sub-regions of Africa. While there have been extensive studies on fertility in West Africa, the underlying spatial variations with regard to within and cross-border variations among countries has received little attention. This study examined spatial variations in fertility desire among thirteen (13) West African countries using data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey conducted between 2010 and 2018. The analysis considers two fertility indicators; preference for another child and ideal number of children, and the spatial units were the states/regions/provinces of the countries included in the study. Bayesian spatial models were specified for the count and multi-categorical response variables respectively, with the use of Markov random field prior for the spatial components while Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation technique was used for parameter estimation. The findings suggest spatial clustering in fertility desire both within and between countries, revealing cross-border spatial contagion. Specifically, women report high number of children as ideal throughout Niger extending to neighbouring northern Nigeria, in Mopti and Koulikoro regions of Mali; in Couffo region of Benin; in Kaffrine region of Senegal and all except Basse region of The Gambia. Additionally, being young, having low or no formal education, living in poor households, being a rural dweller and not using contraceptives were negatively associated with fertility desire. Policies aimed at reducing fertility should consider the spatial dynamics in addition to targeting younger, less educated, rural dwelling women while also strengthening sensitization campaigns for family planning.},

	abstract = {Background : Despite the increasing interest in improving access to and utilization of family planning (FP) methods, contraceptives prevalence rates remain low in Benin, and its benefits are not well studied. This study projected FP’s benefits for maternal health and child survival over the Sustainable Development Goals period. Methods : The Demographic Dividend Model created by the Health Policy Project using a large range of data was applied based exclusively on assumptions on FP policy options between 2015 and 2030. Results : It was found that, under the base scenario with no improvements in FP, education and economic variables, however unrealistic, the number of children per Beninese woman would be the same in 2030 as it was in 2015 – about 4.5 children per woman. Benin’s age structure would remain very young and be dominated by dependents. But, FP–scenarios of improvements in contraceptive variables alone showed a negative and linear relationship between FP use and maternal and child deaths. Under the optimistic scenario, increasing access to and use of FP alone from 7.9\% (2015) to 33.95\% (2030) will save lives of about 200,000 under five year children and 10,000 mothers by 2030. In addition, the average number of children per woman will fall to 3.5 increasing female life expectancy by 5 years. Benin’s age structure will be balanced with more working age people. The country will also record an increase in its human development indicator. Conclusion : To accelerate progresses towards improvement of maternal health and child survival, and get on track in meeting related health targets of SDGs, the present study revealed the importance of strengthening actions toward access to and use of FP in Benin Republic. There is also a need to strengthen education and economic policies to successfully harness the demographic dividend.},

	abstract = {Background: Ending preventable maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality remains a core component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which is a continuation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). It has been documented that most women in developing countries give birth at home without the intervention of skilled attendants despite the prevailing multitude risks associated with childbirth for both mother and the unborn child. The study was aimed at identifying the most significant factors influencing selection of health facility based delivery among reproductive age mothers.
Data and methods: Data was obtained from Benin Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) of 2011-2012 using percent distribution, binomial logistic regression and multinomial regression. Out of 16,599 interviewed only 9,111 were eligible for the present study.
Results: Most (76.0\%) of the respondents gave birth at public health centers, 11\% in private health centers and the rest outside health institutions. Out of 17 variables examined, 13 were found (using Akaike Information Criterion in a stepwise algorithm) to be the most important factors for institutional delivery. Among them, Antenatal Care (ANC) frequency, mother’s education, and household wealth index had most impact on institutional deliveries with positive and linear relationships. Most of the educated women (secondary or above) were more likely to give birth in a private health facility (Private Health OR=5.2, 95\% CI 2.47-10.88; Public Health OR=3.7, 95\% CI 1.82-7.6). Similar results were found among the richest women (Private Health OR=8.6, 95\% CI 3.5-21.3; Public Health OR=4.4, 95\% CI 1.90-10.4). Female education and economic status were the most important factors for institutional delivery preference.
Conclusion: Encouraging regular ANC visits (at least the four recommended visits), and girls’ education up to secondary school will help getting women to deliver in a well-equipped health facility. There is also a need to investigate thoroughly through qualitative researches reasons behind their preference of health facility for reproductive health services, including institutional delivery.},

	abstract = {Cette étude analyse l’espérance de vie scolaire des 6-24 ans (2 962 864 individus) et
identifie les déterminants de leur fréquentation scolaire à partir des données du troisième
Recensement général de la population et de l’habitat (RGPH) du Bénin de 2002. D’un
point de vue descriptif, elle cartographie l’espérance de vie scolaire de la cible. Les
analyses multivariées, quant à elles, prennent la forme des modèles de régression
logistique binomiale.
Les résultats des analyses descriptives montrent d’importantes disparités (disparités
géographiques et disparités selon le sexe et le milieu de résidence) en matière
d’espérance de vie scolaire des enfants. Un enfant qui entre à l’école à 6 ans au Bénin
peut espérer y passer 6,6 années (7,7 années pour les garçons et 5,6 années pour les
filles). D’un département à l’autre, l’indicateur varie de 2,8 années (dans le département
de l’Alibori) à 10,1 années (dans le département du Littoral). À l’échelle communale, un
enfant qui entre à l’école à 6 ans dans la commune de Kérou n'y passera pas plus de
2 années, alors que les enfants de la commune d’Abomey-Calavi y étudieront
10,2 années en cas de non-redoublement.
Les résultats des analyses multivariées vont globalement dans le même sens que ceux
des travaux antérieurs. Les filles sont désavantagées par rapport aux garçons en matière
de scolarisation. Les enfants présentent les meilleures chances de fréquentation scolaire
s’ils cohabitent avec leurs deux parents biologiques, vivent dans les ménages dirigés par
les femmes et résident en milieu urbain. Les chances de fréquentation scolaire des
enfants s’améliorent avec l’augmentation du niveau de vie du ménage et du niveau
d’instruction du chef de ménage. On note une augmentation continue des chances de
fréquentation scolaire des enfants avec l’augmentation de l’espérance de vie scolaire de
leur commune de résidence. Les résultats montrent aussi une baisse continue des
chances de fréquentation scolaire des enfants avec l’âge. Le rôle des facteurs
socioculturels selon l’appartenance ethnique du chef de ménage et sa confession
religieuse n’est pas négligeable. Les analyses spécifiques basées sur le regroupement des communes en fonction du niveau de leur espérance de vie scolaire mettent en
évidence quelques éléments de différences entre groupes de communes.},

	abstract = {One of the major changes in family formation is the increasing tendency for people to enter into co-resident patterning without formalising the union through religious, civil or traditional rites. Despite the implications, this nuptiality behavior which is well documented in the more developed regions, has received negligible scholarly attention in Africa. Using three ranks of DHS surveys (1998-2014) in twelve countries, this study examined the levels, trends, individual and contextual factors associated with consensual union in West Africa. Descriptive results showed a rising trend in consensual union in the sub-region. Multilevel logistic regression analysis suggests that individual-level factors associated with consensual union included education, spousal age gap, second and higher order union, premarital birth, age at first sex, number of sons among others. Contextual predictors were community poverty level, proportion of educated women and proportion of divorced and separated women. Given the health and welfare implications of consensual union, the findings underscore the need for policies and programmatic interventions to protect women in consensual unions, and to extend the benefits of formal marriage to consensual union in case of break up.},
