	abstract = {Models and their simulators are becoming increasingly complex. They are typically the fruit of studying a phenomenon, which leads to a careful arrangement of theories, hypotheses, field data and paradigms (ODEs, PDEs, MASes, cellular automata, etc.). But the challenges and ambitions of modelers are constantly changing and in particular expanding, causing models and simulations to become increasingly expensive, both in terms of their design and analysis. Developing high-performance calculation systems and software for systematic exploration can help to iron out some of these difficulties. But, it is not enough.},
