	abstract = {Young entrepreneurship is an important lever for economic growth and employment creation in developing countries. Credit uptake, however, continues to pose significant limitations to the sustainability of small-scale enterprises. We estimated the impact of credit uptake (formal, informal, and family) on young entrepreneurship performance in Benin, using 2014-2016 panel data from a World Bank survey on enterprise formalization. To address potential endogeneity and ensure robustness of results, we employed multiple models and estimation techniques (fixed-effects and Lewbel approach). Our results showed that, while formal credit was most important for larger firms, smaller firms benefited mainly from flexible (informal or family) credit. The impact of credit uptake was generally higher for women-owned firms. There were also variations in uptake according to firm owner’s age: the impact of formal credit was relatively higher for older firm owners while younger owners benefited more from flexible credit. The findings highlight the importance of Informal and family credit sources, especially for start-ups and small firms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continuing population growth could be detrimental for social and economic wellbeing. Understanding the factors that influence family planning decisions will be important for policy. This paper examines the effect of childhood mortality and women's bargaining power on family planning decisions.
METHODS: Data was from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). A sample of 3313 women in their reproductive age were included in this study. We created variables on women's exposure to and experience of child mortality risks. Three different indicators of women's bargaining power in the household were also used. Probit models were estimated in accordance with the nature of the dependent variable.
RESULTS: Results from the probit models suggest that child mortality has a positive association with higher fertility preference. Also, child mortality risks and woman's bargaining power play important roles in a woman's fertility choices in Ghana. Women with higher bargaining power were likely to prefer fewer children in the face of child mortality risks, compared to women with lower bargaining power.
CONCLUSION: In addition to public sensitization campaigns on the dangers of high fertility and use of contraceptives, the findings of this study emphasize the need to focus on reducing child mortality and improving women bargaining power in developing countries.},

	abstract = {The linkages between international trade integration and economic performance has received significant attention from both policy makers and researchers. There seem to be consensus in the literature to suggest that improved trade openness corresponds to improved economic growth. A missing link in the literature is how trade openness affects specific sectors of the economy. Here we argue that trade openness has significant impact on population health and health financing. The study employed panel data for forty-two (42) Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries over the period 1995-2013. Population health status was measured by total life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate. Three main estimation procedures were used; (i) Fixed effect (FE), (ii) Random Effect (RE) and (iii) the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) models were employed in estimating the relationships. The results showed a positive and significant relationship between trade openness and life expectancy, negative and significant relationship between trade openness and infant mortality rate and negative relationship between trade openness and under-five mortality rate. A positive relationship between trade openness and health financing. The findings of the study support international trade integration across countries in SSA and emphasizes the need for countries to be conscious of gains from trade within sub-sectors of the economy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, economic development discourse has moved beyond increasing economic growth to ensuring that growth also leads to reduction in poverty and inequality. This motivates the current study to examine the relationship between economic growth and poverty in Benin. We used data from the 2006 and 2011 Benin Demographic and Health Surveys and computed a multidimensional poverty index using multiple correspondence analysis. The distribution of growth pro-poorness was analyzed using the Growth Incidence Curves and Non-Income Growth Incidence Curve. Average multidimensional poverty rate was estimated to be about 55.3 percent. The findings show that while growth has generally been pro-poor in Benin, there exist disparities across rural and urban households, and for women as well as the elderly. The findings reinforce the need for broader poverty measures and refocusing poverty reduction strategies to marginalized groups in Benin.},
